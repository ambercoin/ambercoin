AmberCoin 

AmberCoin is an innovative, secure and energy efficient PoW/PoS coin. It uses a faster PoW distribution mechanism to distribute the initial coins, then after 200 days the coin is basically transferred to a PoS coin, where the generation of the coins is both through PoW and PoS interests.
